            Shoes Up was created for the course Semester Project 2. It's an
            e-commerce site selling shoes. This site is built with HTML,
            JavaScript, Bootstrap and Sass, and Strapi is used for the backend.

            The functionalities of this site consists of viewing products as
            well as being able to add them to a shopping cart. There is an admin
            part, where admin can sign in (using JWT for this). If signed in,
            admin has access to adding, editing and deleting products.

            The JS Frameworks CA was to test our React skills, such as doing API
            calls, setting up React Router, using localStorage to save JWT for
            login functionality. The project also has a contact form which uses
            react hook form and yup for form and input validation. The login
            form also makes use of this. When signed in, admin gets access to
            the /admin path.

          <p class="desc-p3">
            The project is split into several smaller components, which makes
            the code more readable and easier to navigate. I have also created
            reusable components where it is practical, like for navigation and
            headings (this is something we have been taught to do).

            Holidaze, aka Project Exam 2, is the result of two years studying
            front-end. The brief was to create a website where users can book
            hotels, B&B's and guesthouses in the Bergen area. As well as sending
            booking enquiries to an establishment, users can also send in a
            contact form to Holidaze. There is also an admin part to the
            assignment where an admin can sign in to view booking enquiries,
            contact messages and add a new establishment. The homepage has a
            search bar typeahead which links to the establishment you click on
            in the dropdown menu.
          </p>
          <p class="desc-p2">
            To build this website I have used React, Bootstrap and Sass. Strapi
            is used for the API's, and is hosted on Heroku. For forms I have
            used react hook form and yup validation. For the API calls I have
            used axios, except for when adding a new establishment as axios and
            FormData wouldn't work together - fetch worked fine though. The
            search bar typeahead is from an NPM package. I have also used
            another NPM package, helmet, for setting title and meta description
            on the pages.
